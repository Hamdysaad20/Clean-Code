## Timon has a candies and his friend, Pumbaa, has b candies, so Pumbaa asked Timon to tell him the value of a−b. However, Timon will tell him the value of a−b if the value is ≥0; otherwise, he will lie and say 0. Since it was a hard task for Timon, he's asking for your help.

Given two numbers a and b, find the answer.

## Input
Only one line containing two numbers a,b (1≤a,b≤109).

       int [] arrOfNums = new int[2];
       int i=0;
        while (i < 2) {

        InputStreamReader read=new InputStreamReader(System.in);
        BufferedReader in=new BufferedReader(read);
        int number=Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());
arrOfNums[i]=number;
i++;
